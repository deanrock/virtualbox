/** @page pg_em         EM - The Execution Monitor / Manager
 *
 * The Execution Monitor/Manager is responsible for running the VM, scheduling
 * the right kind of execution (Raw-mode, Hardware Assisted, Recompiled or
 * Interpreted), and keeping the CPU states in sync. The function
 * EMR3ExecuteVM() is the 'main-loop' of the VM, while each of the execution
 * modes has different inner loops (emR3RawExecute, emR3HwAccExecute, and
 * emR3RemExecute).
 *
 * The interpreted execution is only used to avoid switching between
 * raw-mode/hwaccm and the recompiler when fielding virtualization traps/faults.
 * The interpretation is thus implemented as part of EM.
 *
